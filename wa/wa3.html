      The <strong>Porsche 911</strong> model series (pronounced Nine Eleven or
      in German: Neunelf) is a family of two-door, high performance rear-engine
      sports cars, introduced in September 1964 by Porsche AG of Stuttgart,
      Germany. Now in its eighth generation, all 911s have a rear-mounted
      flat-six engine, and usually 2+2 seating, except for special 2-seater
      variants. Originally, 911s had air-cooled engines, and torsion bar
      suspension, but the 911 has been continuously enhanced, and evolved across
      generations. Though the 911 core concept has remained largely
      unchanged,[1] water-cooled engines were introduced with the 996 series in
      1998,[2][3] and front and rear suspension have been replaced by
      Porsche-specific MacPherson suspension up front, and independent
      multi-link rear suspension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 911 has been raced extensively by private and factory teams, in a
      variety of classes. It is among the most successful competition cars. In
      the mid-1970s, the naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSR won world
      championship races including Targa Florio and the 24 Hours of Daytona. The
      911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. Porsche
      won the World Championship for Makes in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 with
      911-derived models.

    <p>
      The 911 traces its roots to sketches drawn by Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche in
      1959.[7] The Porsche 911 was developed as a more powerful, larger and a
      more comfortable replacement for the 356, the company's first model. The
      new car made its public debut at the 1963 Frankfurt Motor Show[8] (German:
      Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung).[9] The car was developed with the
      proof-of-concept twin-fan Type 745 flat-six engine, but the car presented
      at the auto show had a non-operational mockup of a single-fan engine,
      receiving a working Typ 901 engine in February 1964.[7]
    </p>
    <p>
      It originally was designated as the "Porsche 901" (901 being its internal
      project number). A total of 82 cars were built which were badged as
      901s.[7] However, French automobile manufacturer Peugeot protested on the
      grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by
      three numbers with a zero in the middle. Instead of selling the new model
      with a different name in France, Porsche decided to market the model as
      '911'. Internally, the part numbers for the model carried on the prefix
      901 for years.[7] Production began in September 1964,[9] with the first
      911s exported to the US in February 1965.[7]
    </p>

    <p>
      The first models of the 911 had a rear-mounted 130 hp (97 kW)[1] Type
      901/01 flat-6 engine, in the "boxer" configuration like the 356, the
      engine is air-cooled and displaces 1,991 cc (2.0 L) as compared to the
      356's four-cylinder, 1,582 cc (1.6 L). The car had four seats although the
      rear seats were small, thus it is usually called a 2+2 rather than a
      four-seater (the 356 was also a 2+2). A four or five-speed "Type 901"
      manual transmission was available. The styling was largely penned by
      Ferdinand "Butzi" Porsche, son of Ferdinand "Ferry" Porsche. Butzi Porsche
      initially came up with the front and rear style on a prototype T7 body for
      the 356, based on a lengthened notchback 356B Karmann Hardtop (T5 body)
      with proper space for seating two rear passengers.[10] Erwin Komenda, who
      led the development project on T6 body, which replaced the T5 in 1962, was
      also instrumental in merging the T7 style with new engine, steering,
      transaxle and suspension.

    <p>
      RS stands for Rennsport in German, meaning race sport. The Carrera name
      was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after
      Porsche's class victories in the Carrera Panamericana races in Mexico in
      the 1950s. The RS was developed to meet motorsport homologation
      requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger
      engine (2,687 cc) developing 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp) with Bosch
      (Kugelfischer) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened
      suspension, a "ducktail" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels
      and rear fenders, to fit 185/70VR15 and 215/60VR15 tyres front and rear.
      In RS Touring form it weighed 1,075 kg (2,370 lb), in Sport Lightweight
      form it was about 100 kg (220 lb) lighter, the saving coming from thin
      gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner
      glass. In total, 1,580 units were made, and qualified for the FIA Group 4
      class. 49 Carrera RSR cars were built with 2,808 cc (2.8 L) engines rated
      at 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp).
    </p>

    <p>
      For the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973
      Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat "whale tail"
      in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large
      tyres.

    <h2><a id="911-2011-2019">991 Series (2011–2019)</a></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The 991 introduced in 2011 for the 2012 model year is an entirely new
      platform, only the third since the original 911. Porsche revealed basic
      information on the new Carrera and Carrera S models on 23 August 2011.[52]
      The Carrera is powered by a 355 PS (261 kW; 350 hp) 3.4-litre engine. The
      Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine rated at 406 PS (299 kW; 400 hp). A
      Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power
      output to 436 PS (321 kW; 430 hp). The new 991's overall length grows by
      56 mm (2.2 in) and wheelbase grows by 99 mm (3.9 in) (now 96.5 in.)
      Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly 76 mm (3
      in) towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose
      output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front
      track (51 mm (2 in) wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991
      was headed by Michael Mauer.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more
      three-dimensional. The front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and
      wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin
      coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with
      a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the
      protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the
      interior is the centre console, inspired by the Carrera GT and adopted by
      the Panamera.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="911-GT3">991 GT3</a></h3>

    <img src="/img/Gt3RS.jpg" alt="911 GT3 RS" />

    <p>
      Porsche launched the Renn Sport version of the 911 GT3 at the Geneva Motor
      Show in 2015.[63] Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now
      equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include
      Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is
      made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the
      carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door
      handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage
      behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a
      six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with
      mounting bracket). The 3.8-litre unit found in the previous 997 GT3 is
      replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that has a power output of 500 PS (368 kW;
      493 hp) and 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft) of torque. The transmission is PDK only.
      The car accelerates from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds
      quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 10.9 seconds.
      The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by "paddle
      neutral" — comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual
      gearbox – and a Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, a rear-axle
      steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle
      differential lock are available as standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      In February 2018, Porsche introduced a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue
      their updates for the 991 generation of the 911. Changes include a new
      engine similar to the GT3 and RSR models with a 9,000 rpm redline and a 20
      PS (15 kW; 20 hp) and 10 N⋅m (7.4 lb⋅ft) increase over the outgoing model,
      NACA ducts for brake cooling, modified front fascia (similar to the 991.2
      GT3), side skits and rear wing (similar to the GT2 RS) for increased
      downforce, ball joints on all suspension links, front helper springs,
      lightweight glass for the rear and rear-side windows and a newly developed
      tyre compound. A Weissach package was available that included additional
      carbon fibre body and interior parts as well as magnesium wheels and
      stiffer suspension settings is available as an option.[64]Ï

    <p>
      In 2016, Porsche unveiled a limited production 911 R based on the GT3 RS.
      Production was limited to 991 units worldwide.[65] The Porsche 911 R
      features a rear-engine, 4.0 L boxer 6-cylinder engine producing 375 kW
      (500 hp) at 8,250 rpm and 460 N⋅m (339 lb⋅ft) at 6,250 rpm. It also has a
      dry-sump lubrication system and a 12.9:1 compression ratio.[66] It has an
      overall weight of 1,370 kg (3,020 lb), a high-revving 4.0 L six-cylinder
      naturally aspirated engine from the 991 GT3 RS, and a six-speed manual
      transmission, while air conditioning and audio systems are removable
      options to save weight.[67] The car accelerates from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph)
      in 3.7 seconds and has a top speed of 320 km/h (200 mph).[65]
